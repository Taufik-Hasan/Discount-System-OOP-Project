Discount System ( Object Oriented Programming Language ) Project


#Discount System. 

You are asked to write a discount system for a saloon, which
provides service and sells beauty products. It offers 3 types of memberships Premium, Gold and
Silver members receive a discount of 20%,15% and 10% respectively. For all services provided
customers without memberships receives no discount. All members receive a flat 10% discount
on product purchased (that might change in future)

#Project Analysis:

This project for a Saloon Discount system that provides services and sells beauty products. So
firstly, we need to store those available services and products for saloon serves customers. So,
we have needed two separate classes for services and beauty products which required member
variables and functions. Now focus on customers membership, every customer is a member, So
we need a class member then we separate members to different memberships like as Premium,
Gold, Silver and General member. This all-different membership is a separate class that contains
different discount percentages.

#Membership criteria

If a member deposits 7,000 BDT, then he gets Premium membership. When he purchased a
service, he gets 20% discount on that service's price.

If a member deposits 5,000 BDT, then he gets a Gold membership. When he purchased a service,
he gets 15% discount on that service's price.

If a member deposits 3,000 BDT, then he gets Silver membership. When he purchased a service,
he gets 10% discount on that service's price.

Otherwise, members do not get any membership and discount when they purchased any
services. But all member who bought of any beauty products he gets a flat discount from that
product price, thatâ€™s why we need a flat discount class. If the authority wants this flat percentage
discount to be changeable in the future.
